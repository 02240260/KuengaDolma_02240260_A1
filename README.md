Part A: Python Functions
This program implements five mathematical and string-processing functions. The program provides a menu to select and execute different functions based on user input.
It runs continuously until the user decides to exit.

Features:
        1.Prime Number Sum Calculator
        2.Length Unit Converter
        3.Consonant Counter
        4.Min-Max Number Finder
        5.Palindrome Checker
        6.Word Counter

Program Flow:
The program displays a menu of available functions.
The user selects a function by entering a number (1-6).
The program prompts for necessary input values.
The selected function executes and displays the result.
The user can either perform another calculation or exit the program.

Functions:
1. Prime Number Sum Calculator: Calculates the sum of all prime numbers within the given range.
2. Length Unit Converter: It converts the given length between meters and feet. ('M' for meters to feet, 'F' for feet to meters)
3. Consonant Counter: When you type a string it calculate the number of consonants in the string.
4. Min-Max Number Finder: A series of numbers is entered from which they identify the smallest and largest numbers.
5. Palindrome Checker: When you type a string, Boolean results indicate whether the string is a palindrom or not. Eg: "sarh" and its output: False.
6. Word Counter: From a text file (sample.txt) it counts how many of the words "the", "was", and "and" is in the file.

Part B: Games

This program provides two games for users to play:
1.Guess Number Game – The user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.
2.Rock Paper Scissors Game – A text-based version of the classic game where the user plays against a computer.

Features:
1.Guess Number Game
2.Generates a random number within a specified range.
3.Prompts the user to guess the number.
4.Provides feedback on whether the guess is correct or not.
5.Rock Paper Scissors Game
6.User selects rock, paper, or scissors.
7.The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.
8.The game determines the winner based on standard rules.
9.Exit Option
10.Allows users to exit the program when they choose.
